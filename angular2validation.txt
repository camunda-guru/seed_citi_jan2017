Using Angular 2 Validation CSS Classes
Angular 2 automatically attached CSS classes to the input elements depending on the state of the control. The following class names are used:
ng-touched: Control has been visited
ng-untouched: Control has not been visited
ng-dirty: Control's value has been changed
ng-pristine: Control's value hasn't been changed
ng-valid: Control's value is valid
ng-invalid: Control's value isn't valid
